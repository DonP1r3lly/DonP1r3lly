## <picture><img src = "https://github.com/0xAbdulKhalid/0xAbdulKhalid/raw/main/assets/mdImages/about_me.gif" width = 50px></picture> **About me**

I am a data engineer passionate about computer science and the new challenges of each day.

I began my studies in materials engineering with a master's degree in robotics and programming in Python, followed by several certifications in mechanical design of parts as well as molds and welding pieces. I have participated in mechanical design competitions for 3 years and visited the Goodyear Innovation Center in Luxembourg. From 2019 to 2021, I gained significant knowledge in mechanical design, product design, and materials strength. Additionally, I founded a startup called Martinez99 3D in Luxembourg with the aim of manufacturing parts at home using 3D printing. However, after a major setback and upon the recommendation of a friend, I discovered the field of data. I then resumed my skills in MATLAB and Python programming, realizing my true potential. Furthermore, with the help of advanced technology, I developed my skills in SQL programming, database management, and machine learning.

## More about me:

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on Spain
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning IA and Machine Learning
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on anyone
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about anything
- âš¡ Fun fact: I love data and Cars competition like Formula 1

In this GitHub repository, I will upload content related to both programming and projects I have worked on in the past as well as currently. Enjoy the content, and if you appreciate my profile and the content provided, feel free to contact me.
