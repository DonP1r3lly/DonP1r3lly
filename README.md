### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ my name is David. Data engineer and Materials engineer
Since I was very young, I have been passionate about computer science and cars, as well as competition, such as Formula 1 or endurance racing. Data plays a crucial role today, just as a good car design can be optimized with data as well.

In this GitHub repository, I will upload content related to both programming and projects I have worked on in the past as well as currently. Enjoy the content, and if you appreciate my profile and the content provided, feel free to contact me.
